# AI-Case-Comp

IDEA & APPLICATION
using peekingduck’s computer vision to develop a functional system to detect potential high risk encounters between wild monkeys and park goers in Singapore, presenting such occurrances via a complementary front end to provide operators live coverage, expediting the process to activate emergency aid should the need arise.

TO SOLVE
1. getting the machine to recognise difference between human and monkey
2. defining a “safe distance”
3. showing alert on front end

CONSIDERATIONS & MITIGATION
1. security
  - no storage of video data
  - operators do not have open access to video feeds other than high risk occurrances
  - AI is the primary touch point for data

2. location of cameras
  - areas of higher risk of monkey attacks (e.g. benches, rest areas, places where ppl are more likely to stop and eat
  - along trail with known monkey traffic
